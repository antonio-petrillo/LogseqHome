* #protocol
* Selective Repeat Protocol
Retransmit only the packet that contains an error.
To accomplish that the receiver should send the number of the packet received in the ~ACK~ back to the sender.

Here the sliding window have some other condition, compared to [[GBN]], before it could advance.
Basically the lower index can advance only when the  corresponding ~ACK~ is received.
** Section
+ Dark Blue: packages sended, received and also ACK'd (received without corruption, etc...)
+ Blue: package sended but the sender is still waiting for the ACK
+ Grey: packages that can entry the window size before it's full
+ White: packages that cannot entry the queue/window because it's full

Note that the sender's window could differ from receiver's window.
