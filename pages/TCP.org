** Is more complicated
TCP use more sophisticated approach than the one described in [[transport layer]].
This because of how the TCP work, just think about the connection, when a TCP connection is established it create a new socket on which the client can communicate.
Hence IT need more information.
** Parameter used
Other than the ~source port~ and the ~destination port~ it bundle also the ~source IP~ and ~destination IP~.
With this information extra TCP can distinguish the request and redirect to the correct socket, (basically the host must have a map/hashtable )
