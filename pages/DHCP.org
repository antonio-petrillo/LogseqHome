* ~Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol~
When a new host is connected to the network DHCP give them an unique IP address (unique in that subnet), it also send information about the ~subnet mask~ and the ~default gateway~ (the address).
It's also possible to assign a so called ~static IP~ to a specific host, in other words when an host receive a static IP from DHCP in a network, _every time_ it connect to that network receive the same IP address.

* DHCP server
The server take care of assign an unique IP to the new host.
Usually it is installed in the router, but in more complex case like a big company with thousands of thousands of hosts or a guy obsessed with the cyber-security of the networks, it could be located on a dedicated machine, in this later case the router should be /acknowledged/ on where to find a DHCP server (~relay agent~).
