* It is in between [[application layer]] and [[network layer]].
* What it does
The information a this level is called *segment* or *datagram*, usually *segment* is for [[TCP]]  and *datagram* for [[UDP]] ,  this is just a guideline a lot of authors use them interchangeably.
When a *message* is received from [[application layer]] and they are to big they are divided in multiple segments, in any case they are sended to [[network layer]] .
On the other hand when it receive a *datagram* from the [[network layer]] recompose, *if and only if* the chosen protocol at this level permit it, and the send it to the [[application layer]].
* Protocol at this level
Lately there some new protocol at this level, but the most famous, hence the most important, are [[TCP]] and [[UDP]].
