* Content Delivery Network (CDN)
To avoid a big central web server with all the resource, CDNs replicate the data over the network so, when a client made a request, it can be delivered by the nearest CDN.
* Type of CDN
** Enter deep
Install clusters inside the access ISPs over the world, harder to maintain but this solution is faster in general.
** Bring home
Create a private network, install in this network the clusters with redundant data and the connect to the access ISP, easy to maintain, cheaper but slower in general.
* How they work
When a CDN receive a request it chose one of the cluster that hold the required resource (possible also near to client who made the request) it redirect the request to one of the server  in that cluster.
Usually CDNs use [[DNS]] redirect to accomplish their job.
