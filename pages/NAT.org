* ~Network Address Translation~
** Summary
The NAT is used to reduce the utilization of IP addresses, with IPv4 we have $2^{32}$ addresses which will end soon if every end point has an unique IP.
Basically a NAT server take an IP datagram and change the inner source IP with it's own, it also save the old IP in a table so it can send the response the  correct user.
With NAT all the device in a ~SOHO~ (Small Office, Home Office) can be grouped into a single IP!
