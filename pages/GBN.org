* Go-Back-N
In a GBN protocol the sender can send multiple packet at the same time without wait for the ~ACK~ response, but it cannot send more than ~N~ without waiting for an  ~ACK~ on the pipeline (see [[Computer Networking a Top Down Approach]] chapter 3).
* Sliding window
You can think about it as a sliding window of size N

* Characteristic
** Attributes
*** Base
Oldest sequence's number in the window (See image above)
*** Nextseqnum
Smallest unused sequence's number (See image above)
*** N
Window size (See image above)
** Section
With the previous attributes we can identify 4 section (I'm using the color code from the image above):
+ Dark Blue: packages sended, received and also ACK'd (received without corruption, etc...)
+ Blue: package sended but the sender is still waiting for the ACK
+ Grey: packages that can entry the window size before it's full
+ White: packages that cannot entry the queue/window because it's full
