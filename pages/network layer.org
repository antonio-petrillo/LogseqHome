* #networking, #todo
* Where it lives?
This layer is found in 2 places, the host and the router, this make it a bit hard to understand at first.
Internally it could be divided in *data plane* and *control plane*.
The *control plane* compute a *forwarding table* (generated through *Routing* algos) that will be used by the *data plane* to forward (*forwarding*) the data.
* Introduction
** Overview

** Control and Data plane separation 2 approach

The network layer offer a service called *Best Effort*.
What it guarantees:
1. deliver not guaranteed
2. minimum bandwidth not guaranteed
3. ordered delivery not guaranteed (the packets are delivered in the same order they are sended)
4. it offer encryption services
* What's inside a router
** Overview
As you can evince from the overview, the lower part, input port, output port and switch fabric are implemented in hardware, this is a requirement to reach the maximum speed.
