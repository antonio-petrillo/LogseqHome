* #networking, #todo
* Where it lives?
This layer is found in 2 places, the host and the router, this make it a bit hard to understand at first.
Internally it could be divided in *data plane* and *control plane*.
The *control plane* compute a *forwarding table* (generated through *Routing* algos) that will be used by the *data plane* to forward (*forwarding*) the data.

The network layer offer a service called *Best Effort*.
What it guarantees:
1. deliver not guaranteed
2. minimum bandwidth not guaranteed
3. ordered delivery not guaranteed (the packets are delivered in the same order they are sended)
4. it offer encryption services

** Overview
As you can evince from the overview, the lower part, input port, output port and switch fabric are implemented in hardware, this is a requirement to reach the maximum speed.

** Forwarding approachs
*** Generalized forwarding
There are some rule that are used to forward the packet.
I.E. the packet for a google resource must take the first output port and the packet for Microsoft Outlook must go to the third output port.
*** Destination based forwarding
Let me explain with an analogy:
1. before you enter a roundabout there is a road toll booth.
2. before you can proceed you must say at toll booth where you are going 
3. the employee tell you which you have to take in the roundabout
** Input Port
When a packet reach an import port it is routed to the correct output port through the switch fabric using a forwarding table made by the routing processor.
After the first packet of a stream get an output port, a copy of the forwarding table is stored in the input port so the next packets can go faster.
** Switching Fabric
It connect, *physically*, the input port with the output port, basically it's a network (inside another network).
** Output Port
** Routing Processor
Execute the *Control Plane* function, both classic router and SDN operates here.
** Buffers size (input & output)
When a packet cannot be instantly consumed it is stored in a buffer, when this kind of buffers are full the packet is dropped (this what cause packet loss in the upper layers).
So how big the buffers should be?
*** A classical approach suggest:
$Buff Size = RTT\cdot C$, where ~RTT~ is the ~Round Time Trip~ and ~C~ is the ~link capacity~.
*** A more modern study suggest that when there are ~N~ TCP connections:
$BuffSize = RTT\cdot \frac{C}{\sqrt{N}}$
*** Note
+ A  buffer to big will increase the ~queuing time~.
+ A buffer full of TCP connection will have a rough time to free space in the buffer, after an ACK a new packet will come and /re-full/ the buffer.
+ This problem is known as ~bufferbloat~
***
* Packet Scheduling
As always there are more than one solution:
** Good old [[FIFO]] (aka FCFS - First-Come-First-Served)
** Priority Queue
Each packet is label with a priority level.
Each priority class has his own queue, i.e. HTTP has more priority than SSH, SSH more than IMAP and so on.
If the queue is ~not preemptive~ it is not possible to interrupt the forwarding of a packet.
The priority levels and classes are decided by the ISP.
** Round Robin & WFQ
~WRQ := Weighted Fair Queueing~
The packets are divided into class, without a rigid service priority.
Then each class is served round robin style.

* IP
** IPv4
The packet at the ~network layer~ is known as ~DATAGRAM~.
