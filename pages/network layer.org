* Where it lives?
This layer is found in 2 places, the host and the router, this make it a bit hard to understand at first.
Internally it could be divided in *data plane* and *control plane*.
The *control plane* compute a *forwarding table* (generated through *Routing* algos) that will be used by the *data plane* to forward (*forwarding*) the data.
