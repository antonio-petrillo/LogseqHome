* #networking, #todo
* Where it lives?
This layer is found in 2 places, the host and the router, this make it a bit hard to understand at first.
Internally it could be divided in *data plane* and *control plane*.
The *control plane* compute a *forwarding table* (generated through *Routing* algos) that will be used by the *data plane* to forward (*forwarding*) the data.

The network layer offer a service called *Best Effort*.
What it guarantees:
1. deliver not guaranteed
2. minimum bandwidth not guaranteed
3. ordered delivery not guaranteed (the packets are delivered in the same order they are sended)
4. it offer encryption services
* What's inside a router

** Overview
As you can evince from the overview, the lower part, input port, output port and switch fabric are implemented in hardware, this is a requirement to reach the maximum speed.

** Forwarding approachs
*** Generalized forwarding
There are some rule that are used to forward the segment.
I.E. the segment for a google resource must take the first output port and the segment for Microsoft Outlook must go to the third output port.
*** Destination based forwarding
Let me explain with an analogy:
1. before you enter a roundabout there is a road toll booth.
2. before you can proceed you must say at toll booth where you are going 
3. the employee tell you which you have to take in the roundabout
** Input Port
When a segment reach an import port it is routed to the correct output port through the switch fabric using a forwarding table made by the routing processor.
After the first segment of a stream get an output port, a copy of the forwarding table is stored in the input port so the next segments can go faster.
** Switching Fabric
It connect, *physically*, the input port with the output port, basically it's a network (inside another network).
** Output Port
** Routing Processor
Execute the *Control Plane* function, both classic router and SDN operates here.
