* User Datagram Protocol
Unreliable data transfer, this is [[transport layer]] protocol.
It is a connectionless protocol, hence it didn't do a handshake before the communication begin, like it happens in [[TCP]].
* Multiplexing and Demultiplexing
UDP does nothing fancy about multiplexing and demultiplexing.
The process explained [[transport layer][here]] is the technique used by UDP.
It read the destination port and send the data to that port, hence to the process that uses that port.

Here ~recvfrom~ is used to get the client address and the port, so they can be used to send a response back.
* Less space for packet header
UDP add 8 byte, the header, to each datagram, while
* Error checking
UDP perform a simple error checking process on the datagram
